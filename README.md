Uploaded a "TestEMail.txt" file which has the email content for testing purpose. You may can use that.
Tried to extract ".msg" / ".eml" file but failed to read the data, that is why used ".txt" file for extracting data.
It was hard to extract xml tags from the email, this is the solution I developed after brainstorming. Please check.
